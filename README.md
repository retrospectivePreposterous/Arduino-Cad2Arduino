# Requirements
**Software**

- Arduino IDE. Download for free at https://www.arduino.cc/
- Windows OS (Tested on Windows 8 and higher versions).
- Powershell ISE.
- Cad software compatible with AutoLISP scripting. 
  - Autocad or any of its verticals (Tested on Autocad 2019 and Civil 3D 2019).
  - BricsCad.
  - BabaCad.
  - Archicad.

**Hardware**

Cad2Arduino is an extensible core designed to allow more than the suggested hardware. However, the default version is assemblied with the following hardware:
- Arduino Mega 2560. Arduino Nano or Uno are suitable.
- 0.96 Inch Oled display.
- 8x8 Led Matrix Module MAX7219.
- SG90 Microservo.
- 3V-12V Passive buzzer.
- 5mm LED.
- 220Î© resistor.
- Wire jumpers.
- Mini breadboard.

# Setup
> include terms/tags that can be searched



# HandyCommandLine setup

```powershell
$port = New-Object System.IO.Ports.SerialPort
$port.PortName = "COM7" #RENAME TO YOUR CURRENT PORT.
$port.BaudRate = "9600"
$port.open() 

Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 500
Write-Host " [HandyCommandLine 1.0 -- by retrospectivePreposterous]"
Write-Host " Enter EXIT to close. Readlines are disabled in this feature"
Write-Host "----------------------------------------------------------------"
do {
$codeline = Read-Host 
if ($codeline -ne "exit") {
$port.Write("$codeline`r") 
Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 500
}
} until ( $codeline -eq "exit" ) 

$port.close() 
```

# HandyCommandLine example

```shell
$ brew update
$ brew install fvcproductions
```

# Test samples

**Led Matrix:**
- The Led Matrix shows the Cad Object Entity as a common symbol.
- `EntityToMatrix_ETM.lsp` was used in this case.

**Oled Display:**
- Property data of selected object is shown in the Oled Display.
- `PropertyToOled_PTO.lsp` was used in this case.

**Servo:**
- Block orientation property is assimilated by the servo.
- `BlockAngleToServo_ATS.lsp` was used in this case.
